Thank you for being interested in my coding journey!
Keep in mind the following instructions to be able to work with these projects.

## Weather app
To have a fully functional weather app you'll need to do the following:

> 1st: create a 'config.js' file

> 2nd: copy this line with YOUR OpenWeather provider API key

```const configApiKey = 'YourApiKeyHere';```
